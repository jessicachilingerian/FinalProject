                <p1>The last quote my high school literature teacher shared with us before she announced she was moving to another school district. Time and time I come back and reflect on this statement. It has drastically shaped my perspective on the world. I’m driven by my friendships and relationships, always embracing new people and looking for ways to connect with and help them. Extremely extroverted, I look forward to meeting strangers wherever I go, finding common ground and shared interests. I get excited when connecting over even the smallest of things. This has proved to be a strength for me to develop long lasting, deeper relationships.
                </p1>

                <p2>
                    While I didn’t always know how to articulate my passion for growing my network and discovering more about people’s passions and interests, this description from the Clifton Strengths Finder test that has appeared both in my 2014 results and again more recently in 2020 sums it up perfectly:
                </p2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p3>
                    “You enjoy the challenge of meeting new people and getting them to like you. Strangers are rarely intimidating to you. On the contrary, strangers can be energizing. You are drawn to them. You want to learn their names, ask them questions, and find some area of common interest so that you can strike up a conversation and build rapport. In your world there are no strangers, only friends you haven’t met yet - lots of them.”

                    To some, the origin stories of my strongest relationships may seem a bit odd.

                    As a high school junior, I was curious to see what studying business would be like and wanted to go to one of those pre-college summer programs. I typed in ‘summer business program for high school students’ and came across the Young Women’s Institute. I was accepted and I packed my bags for Bloomington, Indiana. I didn’t really know what was beyond California, having traveled very little before this. Throughout the program, I made friends from Illinois, Indiana, Connecticut, Massachusetts and more. We toured each others lives on Google Earth. After senior year, we once again split up across the country: UC Berkeley, Columbia, UMass, Indiana University, Florida State University. The YWI girls and I are bonded for life. We’ve all had reunions some way or another in the past 6 years. Ashley Chen and I navigated UC Berkeley together (both the academics & the restaurants). Eve Falk introduced me to her best friend from college Clara Baumgarten who signed a lease to live in SF with us all the way from Massachusetts before even stepping foot in the apartment or meeting her future roomies in real life. Amulya Kandikonda moved from NY out to SF where we reconnected and introduced each other to our college circles. We went on long hikes where we pieced together our future hopes and dreams. Niveda Kumar made the trek out to SF in early January and visited me at work for a quick coffee and catch up. While we haven’t been able to reunite physically, we've all kept in touch through social media and even have a Zoom Call scheduled for next week, our second one of the quarantine.

                    A confused little Freshman, I turned to our campus’ Free & For Sale Facebook page in search of a textbook for my math prerequisite course. I purchased from Jessica Dong who would later become my big in the best Big/Little pairing in the club’s history (IMO) ‘Jess & Jess’. This random 'textbook' exchange introduced me to the Business Careers in Entertainment Club (BCEC) where I felt empowered to follow my passions for fashion and entertainment. My curiosity led me to volunteer at SF Fashion Week where I met one of the most talented and passionate people in my life, Manuela Perez. Our early hang outs involved water color painting at Café Strada while discussing mindfulness and positivity. We’d add on two compassionate and empathetic friends Paige Pham and Donia Shirazi who we were also destined to meet.

                    I had no idea what coding was, yet my first semester of college I enrolled in the Intro to Intro to Computer Science Class. No that isn’t a typo. It was an introduction class for non novices to test the waters before jumping into the first prerequisite class. Completely lost and hopeless, I sat outside of my dorm building. I started asking random people walking by if they knew anything or could help. To my surprise, one girl volunteered her roommate. She took me to her dorm, checked me in at the front desk (even though we had met 5 minutes prior) and we surprised her roommate, Vaishnavi Yandapalli, who was in the lounge also working on the project. Our friendship began first as study partners. We exchanged numbers and helped each other solve difficult coding questions. If we couldn’t figure them out, we took turns going to office hours to bug the Teaching Assistant’s for hints. One day at office hours, I recognized another girl, Tanji Saraf Chavez. Tanji and I had briefly talked at Freshman Orientation three months prior. We exchanged information too and the three of us became a ‘study group’.  After the class ended, Vaish & Tanji continued on to the next course in the series while I decided to explore other disciplines. I had no idea at the time, but these two girls would go on to become my best friends throughout all of college. We’d later meet two more besties Sonia Scott & Aleha Valika and form a solid and unbreakable squad. Even impacted by the displacements caused by COVID-19, we still talk every day, actually more like every hour.

                    I could literally write thousands of these. I am always meeting people in unexpected ways. In line, on transit, and even on Instagram. What may feel like a small encounter ends up developing into a genuine life long friendship. These people have all in some way impacted my life and shaped me into who I have become. I believe that everyone we meet has a place in our journey, and with that I thank you all for your part in mine.

          <h1> Till I Dance Again </h1>   
          <p9>
            There is nothing I miss more than being on the dance floor. I used to complain about paying cover to get into bars but now I would gladly pay $10 entry for the rest of my life just for things to go back to normal- to be dripping with sweat and begging the DJ to play my song.
          </p9>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p10>
            I started dancing when I was 5 or 6. Ballet, tap, jazz, I did it all. I was formally trained, I had the technique, the shoes, the ‘swagger’. I took a break from classes around middle school as work piled up and after schools were consumed by sports and other extra curricular activities. I had to find other outlets to dance. Occasionally in school, I’d gather a large group (12-15 girls) together to perform at the talent show: our first year we did Thriller, another year was Schools Out for Summer (we had blow up guitars), and then finally, a mashup of the Glee version of Don’t Stop Believin’ (yikes) and Party Rock Anthem. I convinced myself and my classmates that I was a qualified choreographer. Everyone agreed to my vision and we met to practice early in the morning before school.
          </p10>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p11>
            When I went away to college, I had to get even more creative. I experimented with different types of dance. I embraced my Armenian heritage in our Armenian Student Association’s Dance Troop Zartonk. Aside from annual Armenian picnics and summer camp, this was my first formal training in traditional Armenian dancing. I felt proud of the beautiful symbolisms of movements and further connected to my cultural roots and Armenian classmates.
          </p11>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p12>
            It wasn’t until Senior year that one of my good friends, Liliana, persuaded me to return to the dance studio once again. She had invited me multiple times but I was always too shy. Eventually I ran out of excuses and agreed to come. I was completely taken aback. The instructors had a way about them that could make anyone feel like they belonged. It truly was a dance community. This environment was unlike anything I had yet experienced. I was in my element and I felt like I had discovered the part of myself that was missing. I walked away with a new dance routine that I could practice, perfect, and eventually perform at any social events.
          </p12>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p13>
            Connected once again with my passion, I was confronted with a harsh reality. Dancing, like any hobby requires immense dedication and practice. I was reminded of the early days in my dance journey when my mom would come to classes to record the choreography for me to practice at home. It never came easy to me. I think over the years I forgot about this struggle and dancing became just about having fun and experimenting with new styles in an uncontrolled setting.
          </p13>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p14>
            In one phase of quarantine, I watched these old VHS tapes from classes. I compared the videos from the practice classes with the footage from the final performance. Honestly, this provided harsh evidence that I was not as good a dancer as I thought I was. I was initially confused at where this confidence in my dancing capabilities had come from over the years. What I’ve come to accept is that my confidence in this space comes from my energetic and positive spirit. I may not be the best dancer in the room, but I am motivated to work hard and strive for improvement. I am able to forgive myself for small mistakes I make and look at the greater picture. I am driven by my love for experimenting with new moves and mediums. I find thrill in competing to win over a crowd. My brain and body align and I am able to unleash my creativity through my body’s movement.
          </p14>

          <p15>
            While in person dance classes are on pause, I found my old jazz shoes in a box under my bed. I’ve transformed my childhood bedroom into a makeshift dance studio. I am actively working to regain my flexibility with 10 minute Youtube stretch videos. While my cardio isn’t what it was a few months ago, I am excited to one day perform again for crowds of strangers at packed bars, meet a cute boy during the Tamzaraonal Armenian Wedding dance, and choreograph talent show routines as an alternative source of income.

        <h1> Creek Fire- Too Close to Home
        </h1>  
        <p16>
            On Friday, I headed up to the mountains with my sister for a spontaneous night at China Peak- drinks, food, and live music. As quarantine has lasted much longer than anyone anticipated, I was excited to get out of ‘town’ (45 minute trek) and be surrounded by a sublime and picturesque landscape. We stopped off at Cressman’s General Store on the way to our mountain retreat to grab cookies and brownies to-go. Little did we know, this iconic community staple founded in 1904 would perish in the California Creek Fire just 3 days later. 
        </p16> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <p17>
            I feel unsettled. How could something that was just there be destroyed so quickly? While this was only my second visit to the surrounding forests of my hometown Fresno, California, I can’t help but think that the timing was impeccable. We got home from our night out at 12 am, and the fires reportedly started shortly thereafter. I can’t imagine losing my home or my pets. I keep thinking back to the innocent and helpless animals displaced from their natural habitat. This devastating fire season isn’t new, but this time it hit especially close to home. 
            </p17> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <p18>
            I remember in Fall 2018, The ‘Camp Fire’ in Butte County wiped out the surrounding community in Paradise, California. This fire was quoted as being ‘the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.’ This disaster became a hot topic in my city planning classes that semester. As the air quality worsened, my peers and I looked to the administration to cancel classes and let us go home early to begin our Thanksgiving break. I’d like to say I was especially thankful that year, but once I got home and the air was better, I became complacent, ignoring news headlines that made me sad or didn’t affect me. It’s easy to become jaded, especially in 2020 as something tragic seems to happen every other day. 
        </p18>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p19>
            As the fires escalate and destroy a beautiful and natural landscape in the Central Valley, I wanted to use my platform to encourage my audiences to find ways to stay engaged through either activism or community participation during these difficult times.
